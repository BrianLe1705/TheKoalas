									<h3 class="major">OVERVIEW</h3>
									<p>The project that we decided to pursue is a recipe app that curates a list of recipes based off of the food in the users’ pantry. It hopes to solve the problem of not knowing how to use ingredients that people have around their house as well as giving ideas for what to make when you don’t have something specific in mind.</p>

									<h3 class="major">app features</h3>
									
									<h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
									<p>This App will be sold for free on the App store. They will be integrated AI guidance for beginners and voice assist technology. This App will be for mobile only and we also have our own website that works like an online app. </p>
									<p>It is also designed to serve any person that has the needs of cooking no matter cooking skills or experience, anyone can cook. However, our major target users are people between 20 and 35, mostly students and busy adults who are lack of cooking skills and experience.</p>
									
									<h4><strong>Key features</strong></h4>
									<p>Our app is designed to serve any person that has the needs of cooking no matter cooking skills or experience, anyone can cook. However, our major target users are people between 20 to 35, mostly students and busy adults who are lack of cooking skills and experience.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>The user will have a list of ingredients and the amount that they have in their current pantry. They will be able to search and select those ingredients from a list of supported food.</li>
										<li>A separate list of ingredients to be bought, they can be added manually or through the recipe feature.</li>
										<li>This list should be filterable with categories such as vegetables, fruit, oils, etc. </li>
										<li>The app will also have an online list of recipes. Some of these will be curated but there is the potential for user-submitted entries to expand the available options. </li>
										<li>This list should have data on each recipe, including time required, ingredients used, style of cuisine, user ratings, and more. It should be sortable based off of this data.</li>
										<li>The app will then be able to match and suggest recipes based off of the available ingredients. The user should also be able to view and pick recipes that they currently don’t have the ingredients for and add the missing ones too a shopping list.</li>
									</ul>
									<h3 class="major">tools and technology</h3>
									<p>&bull; Private cloud for administrate database and public cloud for users information</p>
									<p>&bull; Computer languages: front-end part: html/css, javascript, python, back-end part: C#, javascript, swift (because it’s for both iOS and android OS). </p>
									<p>&bull; UI: multi-task platform, smooth animation, user-friendly appearance, large personal storage.</p>
									<h3 class="major">target user</h3>
									<p>The app should be usable for anyone as the features are fairly agnostic to who would want them. Without any sort of user group testing yet we can’t be sure what demographics would regularly use our app.</p>
									<p>A naive estimation would be that the app primarily benefits young professionals who haven’t yet built their own collection of recipes, but want to learn how to use what they have.This also makes sense as generally app user groups tend to skew younger</p>
									<p>With this in mind the user group we will initially target is 20-40 year olds. Specifically those with full time jobs and don’t have the time to work out what to buy and how to use the ingredients they have access to themselves.</p>

									<h2 class="major">IT Work</h2>
										<p>I interviewed a family friend who happened to have worked in the IT industry for many years. What he does is mostly a mix of programming and meeting with clients. He also does some amount of researching and testing as well at different stages of a project. He said that it depends on the exact field and job you have what exactly you will have to do.</p>										
										<p>Generally the two groups that he interacts with are clients and co-workers. Specifically he often meets with a liason from the client company to frequently discuss the needs and design specification. He also interacts with the other people working on the project inorder to decide how to design the application as well as coordinate themselves for what they are working on.</p>									
										<p>He spends roughly half of his time actually doing computer work, programming, designing, and researching. The other half is spent in meetings with clients and coworkers to plan and design the program.</p>
										<p>Successfully meeting client expectations was the most challenging thing for him to meet most of the time. A lot of our discussion was focused on the transition from waterfall to agile models of development. The waterfall model is where all specifications and milestones as set from the beginning of the project. While this is an intuitive and hands off model to use and it was the standard in the industry for many years, the model was massively prone to going over time and over budget. In particular it is very hard to estimate exactly how long a project will take especially so far in advance. Also frequently clients will change their minds about different elements of the project and want to adjust the specification or else become dissatisfied with the end result, but of course the programming professionals were contracted to meet the original specifications and are stuck to rigid structure set out for them. The agile model counteracts many of the failings of the waterfall model. In agile development is broken up into cycles of feedback. Short cycles, between 2-3 weeks, of feedback with a designated person from the client company are maintained and then larger group feedback meetings with all the stakeholders one a larger time frame, around 2 months. The project team in this structure is contracted for a period of time rather than for a complete product. This means that they are encouraged to complete key features of the product and can change the specifications as they receive feedback on the work as it is done.</p>

										<p>The project that we decided to pursue is a recipe app that curates a list of recipes based off of the food in the users’ pantry. It hopes to solve the problem of not knowing how to use ingredients that people have around their house as well as giving ideas for what to make when you don’t have something specific in mind.<br>The app will also have to have options for alerting the user to allergens or religiously prohibited foods.<br>Some challenges that we may face in developing this app are generating and curating a list of recipes.</p>

											<p><strong>Results analyzing</strong></p>
											<ul>
												<li>Aiden’s Myer-Briggs test (ISTP) states he is a natural builder and likes practical work. His personality type strengths include being cheerful and good natured, spontaneous and rational, prioritisation and calmness even in stressful situations. On the other hand, the Myer-Briggs test also states that he can be quite stubborn with a lack of commitment.</li>
												<li>Hung and Matthew share the same Myer-Briggs test (INFJ) result which highlights their ability to turn their ideas into real life. Their strength lies in their creativity, determination, passion and altruistism. They are however prone to being sensitive perfectionist who may burn out easily.</li>
												<li>Michelle’s Myer-Briggs test (ENFP) highlights her desire for emotional connection among her peers. ENFP’s are observant and curious communicators, however they also have poor practical skills and find it difficult to focus as they’re always lost in thought.</li>
												<li>Based on these results along with our learning style, there may be a bit of a clash due to Hung and Matthew being much higher focused people opposed to Michelle and Aiden. It is good to know that we may need to change the working style a bit to tailor towards everyone’s strengths and weaknesses.</li>

										<h3 class="major">Ideal Jobs Comparison</h3>
										<p>Michelle’s ideal job prioritizes location, incentives, targets and work/life balance. She is goal-oriented within the workforce and likes having a target to meet with straightforward tasks in an organised team. Her ideal job in the future is to be a Senior Game/Web developer with her own team. Salary is not a priority however she wants to live comfortably doing what she loves. Michelle dislikes jobs with bad management, lack of career growth, with no work/life balance. </p>
										<p>Matthews ideal job: flexibility and variety. Unknown for now. Dislikes: demanding jobs, bad management </p>
										<p>Aiden prioritizes workplace and time flexibility for his ideal's job that he could work anytime, any place he wants. His ideal career is becoming a game developer. He wants to be employed in companies that are potential to grow and compete in the global market. Aiden dislikes demanding jobs, or jobs with strict rules in term of workplace and working time. </p>
										<p>Hung ideal job: professional and respectful company, high-skill programming requirements, flexibility. Front end developer. Dislikes: bad management, stressful environment due to difficult tasks </p>
										<p><strong>Matthew: </strong>Zipline is a company that builds, programs, and operates drones that deliver blood and plasma for transfusion in Rwandan hospitals. Because the roads there are underdeveloped and are often flooded or inaccessible, drones allow the blood to be centrally stored and transferred when needed which leads to less waste and less shortages. I am not sure exactly what position is suitable for me yet but I would love to work for this company. The technical problems seem interesting to solve as well as being involved in a company that is making a difference in countries with underdeveloped infrastructure.</p>
										
										
										
										<h3 class="major">Group reflection</h3>
										<p>Something that we were very good at planning and distributing the work between our group members. This meant that we had clear individual goals and knew how to complete the assignment. We were also each responsible about completing that work load. It didn’t feel like any individual member was carrying the entire workload or that one member was leaving all their work for the others. In addition to this, the group was very responsive to communication and feedback. This made it a lot easier to make decisions and arrange meetings.</p>
										<p>A point of improvement for our group is that we could have structured our time better, such as having weekly checkpoints for our individual parts. Because of this, we didn’t complete a lot of the work early. It didn’t lead to a rush at the end but having work done earlier would have given us more time to edit and finalize parts of the work. Although this was probably result of getting comfortable with the group and learning how to work together. This is useful knowledge however because it teaches us to organise time early in a group assignment.</p>
										<p>It was surprising how well we synergized together. As a group we got along really well and naturally which wasn’t any of our expectations going into the assignment. This was a big benefit as there were no significant conflicts to resolve and the work got done fairly succinctly. It was surprisingly hard to arrange meetings. Although we often made attempts, many of the group members had frequent obligations or schedules that made it hard to meet regularly. Although we did manage to meet outside of class, we definitely should have done so more frequently to keep ourselves up to date.</p>
										<p>Everyone one works at their own pace and learning to work with and around that is a skill that takes practice. We also learned that in order to get things done some member or members of the group need to step into a leadership role if one is not assigned. This initially proved a challenge but once we became more comfortable together we were able to plan and coordinate more.</p>
